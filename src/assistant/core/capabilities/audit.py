"""Guardrail decision audit trail — agent-iam (P25).

Every guardrail decision made for an :class:`ActionRequest` carrying an
:class:`AgentIdentity` is emitted as a structured audit record through
the EXISTING telemetry provider (observability spec: ``start_span`` is
the sanctioned escape hatch for non-first-class operations, so the
closed trace-op vocabulary is untouched). There is no separate audit
store — telemetry is the sink; a dedicated durable audit log is
deferred alongside the approval interrupt/resume flow.

Record shape (span ``guardrail.decision`` attributes):

- ``action_type`` / ``resource`` — what was requested
- ``persona`` / ``role`` — the acting principal
- ``delegation_chain`` (list, root-first) + ``chain_depth`` — how the
  authority arrived (P12 delegation chains become attributable here)
- ``session_id`` / ``issued_at`` — correlation with the session
- ``decision`` — ``allow`` | ``deny`` | ``require_confirmation``
- ``reason`` — the guardrail's stated reason (may be empty on allow)

Requests without an identity are NOT audited — pre-P25 call sites keep
their exact behavior; the identity-attaching sites (delegation spawner,
model-call hook, harness spawn paths) opt in by construction. Emission
is defensive: a failing provider logs a WARNING and never breaks the
action flow (same posture as memory capture).

P30 durable-sessions adds the deferred durable sink: when the acting
persona has durable sessions configured (an audit sink registered via
``assistant.core.durable``), the same record is ALSO appended to the
``audit_log`` table on the persona DB. Telemetry spans continue
regardless; the durable append is best-effort and never changes
enforcement outcomes.
