# guardrail-provider Specification

## Purpose
Governs the `GuardrailProvider` runtime-checkable protocol together with
its `ActionRequest`/`ActionDecision` types, the `RiskLevel` enumeration,
and the `AllowAllGuardrails` stub. It exists to give each persona a
pluggable pre-action approval point for risky operations (tool calls,
delegation) without hard-coding policy into core code. Consumers are the
delegation spawner and harness execution paths, which receive the provider
through the capability resolver; the stub keeps behavior permissive until a
persona supplies a real policy.
## Requirements
### Requirement: GuardrailProvider Protocol

The system SHALL define a `GuardrailProvider` runtime-checkable Protocol
with the methods `check_action(action: ActionRequest) → ActionDecision`,
`check_delegation(parent_role, sub_role, task) → ActionDecision`, and
`declare_risk(action: ActionRequest) → RiskLevel`.

#### Scenario: Stub implementation satisfies Protocol

- **WHEN** a class implements `check_action`, `check_delegation`, and
  `declare_risk` with the correct signatures
- **THEN** `isinstance(instance, GuardrailProvider)` MUST return `True`

#### Scenario: Non-conforming class rejected

- **WHEN** a class is missing the `check_delegation` method
- **THEN** `isinstance(instance, GuardrailProvider)` MUST return `False`

### Requirement: ActionRequest and ActionDecision Types

The system SHALL define an `ActionRequest` dataclass with fields
`action_type: str`, `resource: str`, `persona: str`, `role: str`, and
`metadata: dict[str, Any]`; and an `ActionDecision` dataclass with
fields `allowed: bool`, `reason: str`, and
`require_confirmation: bool`.

#### Scenario: ActionRequest captures action context

- **WHEN** an `ActionRequest` is created with `action_type="tool_call"`,
  `resource="gmail.send"`, `persona="personal"`, `role="chief_of_staff"`
- **THEN** all fields MUST be accessible as typed attributes

#### Scenario: ActionDecision defaults

- **WHEN** an `ActionDecision` is created with `allowed=True`
- **THEN** `reason` MUST default to `""`
- **AND** `require_confirmation` MUST default to `False`

### Requirement: AllowAllGuardrails Stub

The system SHALL provide an `AllowAllGuardrails` implementation that
returns `ActionDecision(allowed=True)` for all `check_action` and
`check_delegation` calls, and `RiskLevel.LOW` for all `declare_risk`
calls.

#### Scenario: Stub allows all actions

- **WHEN** `AllowAllGuardrails().check_action(any_request)` is called
- **THEN** the returned `ActionDecision.allowed` MUST be `True`

#### Scenario: Stub allows all delegations

- **WHEN** `AllowAllGuardrails().check_delegation(parent, sub, task)` is
  called
- **THEN** the returned `ActionDecision.allowed` MUST be `True`

#### Scenario: Stub declares low risk

- **WHEN** `AllowAllGuardrails().declare_risk(any_request)` is called
- **THEN** the returned value MUST equal `RiskLevel.LOW`

### Requirement: RiskLevel Enumeration

The system SHALL define a `RiskLevel` enumeration with values `LOW`,
`MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, and `CRITICAL`, ordered by severity.

#### Scenario: Ordering

- **WHEN** `RiskLevel.LOW` and `RiskLevel.HIGH` are compared
- **THEN** `RiskLevel.LOW < RiskLevel.HIGH` MUST be `True`

### Requirement: ApprovalRequest Type

The system SHALL define an `ApprovalRequest` dataclass — the
channel-agnostic shape in which a suspended run asks a human for a
decision — mirroring the MCP elicitation schema: `approval_id: str`
(unique, stable across suspend/resume), `message: str`
(human-readable explanation of what approval is being requested and
why), `requested_schema: dict[str, Any]` (a restricted JSON Schema
describing the decision payload; the default schema is an
approve/deny boolean plus an optional free-text justification),
`action: ActionRequest` (the blocked action), `risk: RiskLevel` (the
guardrail's declared risk tier), `thread_id: str` (the suspended
session), and `created_at` timestamp. Channels (AG-UI first; email
and messaging later; MCP elicitation and A2A `input-required` on
served surfaces) are transports that render an `ApprovalRequest` and
capture its decision — no channel defines its own approval shape.

#### Scenario: ApprovalRequest mirrors MCP elicitation

- **WHEN** an `ApprovalRequest` is constructed for a blocked
  `gmail.send` action at `RiskLevel.HIGH`
- **THEN** all fields MUST be accessible as typed attributes
- **AND** the (`message`, `requested_schema`) pair MUST be directly
  representable as an MCP elicitation request without translation

#### Scenario: Default decision schema is approve/deny

- **WHEN** an `ApprovalRequest` is constructed without an explicit
  `requested_schema`
- **THEN** its schema MUST describe an approve/deny boolean and an
  optional justification string

### Requirement: Approval Interrupt and Resume

The system SHALL consume `ActionDecision.require_confirmation`: when a
`GuardrailProvider` returns a decision with
`require_confirmation=True`, the run MUST suspend via the
durable-session checkpoint (harness-adapter durable-session contract)
rather than proceeding or failing, and an `ApprovalRequest` — risk-
tiered from `declare_risk` — MUST be emitted to the active channel.
The suspended state MUST survive process restarts, so approval
round-trips spanning hours (e.g., decision by email reply or signed
link) resolve against the same checkpoint. On receipt of a decision
the run MUST resume from the checkpoint exactly once: an approve
decision executes the blocked action, a deny decision resumes with
the denial surfaced to the agent, and every request/decision pair
(approval id, action, risk, decider channel, decision payload,
timestamps) MUST be recorded in an audit trail.

#### Scenario: require_confirmation suspends instead of executing

- **WHEN** `check_action` returns
  `ActionDecision(allowed=True, require_confirmation=True)` for a tool
  call
- **THEN** the action MUST NOT execute
- **AND** the run MUST be checkpointed in a suspended state
- **AND** an `ApprovalRequest` referencing the run's `thread_id` MUST
  be emitted

#### Scenario: Suspend survives a restart

- **WHEN** a run is suspended awaiting approval
- **AND** the serving process restarts before the decision arrives
- **THEN** delivering the decision afterwards MUST still resume the
  original run from its checkpoint

#### Scenario: Approved decision resumes and executes

- **WHEN** an approve decision is delivered for a pending
  `approval_id`
- **THEN** the suspended run MUST resume and execute the blocked
  action exactly once
- **AND** the audit trail MUST record the request and the decision

#### Scenario: Denied decision resumes without executing

- **WHEN** a deny decision is delivered for a pending `approval_id`
- **THEN** the blocked action MUST NOT execute
- **AND** the run MUST resume with the denial (and any justification)
  visible to the agent
- **AND** the audit trail MUST record the outcome

#### Scenario: Duplicate decisions are idempotent

- **WHEN** two decisions arrive for the same `approval_id`
- **THEN** only the first MUST take effect
- **AND** the second MUST be rejected and recorded, not replayed

### Requirement: Escalation With Justification

The system SHALL support Codex-style escalation-with-justification: an
action denied by policy (`allowed=False`) MAY carry a
machine-readable escalation — the original `ActionRequest` plus a
justification produced by the requesting agent — which re-enters the
approval interrupt flow as an `ApprovalRequest` at a risk tier no
lower than the guardrail's `declare_risk` for that action. Escalation
is a request for human override, never a bypass: without an explicit
approve decision the action remains denied, and escalation attempts
MUST appear in the same audit trail as ordinary approvals.

#### Scenario: Denied action escalates to a human

- **WHEN** `check_action` returns `ActionDecision(allowed=False)` for
  an action
- **AND** the agent submits an escalation with a justification string
- **THEN** an `ApprovalRequest` MUST be emitted carrying the original
  action and the justification
- **AND** the run MUST suspend awaiting the decision

#### Scenario: Unanswered escalation stays denied

- **WHEN** an escalation is emitted and no approve decision is ever
  delivered
- **THEN** the action MUST NOT execute
- **AND** the audit trail MUST record the escalation as unresolved or
  denied

### Requirement: PolicyGuardrails Implementation

The system SHALL provide a `PolicyGuardrails` implementation of the
`GuardrailProvider` protocol, configured from a persona `guardrails:`
section with three parts: `policies:` (ordered action rules),
`budgets.model_call:` (USD ceilings), and `delegation:` (sub-role
constraints). The section SHALL be parsed and validated at persona
load into a typed `GuardrailConfig`; unknown keys, unknown policy
effects, and malformed numbers MUST fail persona load with an
actionable error naming the offender. A persona that declares no
`guardrails:` section (or an empty one) keeps `AllowAllGuardrails`
behavior unchanged.

#### Scenario: PolicyGuardrails satisfies the protocol

- **WHEN** a `PolicyGuardrails` instance is constructed from any
  valid `GuardrailConfig`
- **THEN** `isinstance(instance, GuardrailProvider)` MUST return
  `True`

#### Scenario: Invalid guardrails section fails persona load

- **WHEN** a persona declares a policy with `effect: not-an-effect`
- **THEN** persona load MUST raise an error naming the invalid effect

### Requirement: Guardrail Action Policies

The system SHALL evaluate `guardrails.policies` in declaration order
with first-match-wins semantics: a policy matches when its
`action_type` equals the request's action type (or is `"*"`) and its
`resource` glob matches the request's resource. Effects: `deny`
returns `allowed=False` with the policy's reason;
`require_confirmation` returns `allowed=True,
require_confirmation=True`; `allow` matches without bypassing budget
ceilings. For `model_call` actions, a `require_confirmation` decision
is treated as a denial by the model-binding budget hook until the
approval interrupt flow exists (the "Confirmation Requests Deny Until
Interrupt Flow Exists" requirement of the model-provider capability
is preserved unchanged — this change does NOT build interrupt or
resume).

#### Scenario: Deny policy blocks a matching resource

- **WHEN** a policy `{action_type: model_call, resource:
  "expensive-*", effect: deny}` is declared
- **AND** `check_action` is called for resource `expensive-opus`
- **THEN** the decision MUST have `allowed=False`
- **AND** a request for resource `cheap-model` MUST be allowed

#### Scenario: First matching policy wins

- **WHEN** an allow policy for resource `special` precedes a deny
  policy for resource `*`
- **THEN** `check_action` for `special` MUST allow
- **AND** `check_action` for any other resource MUST deny

#### Scenario: require_confirmation on model_call denies at the binding

- **WHEN** a `require_confirmation` policy matches a `model_call`
  request
- **AND** the model binding's `check_model_call` hook consumes the
  decision
- **THEN** the dispatch MUST be refused with an error naming the
  confirmation requirement

### Requirement: Model Call Budget Ceilings

The system SHALL enforce per-persona daily and monthly USD ceilings
on `model_call` actions when `guardrails.budgets.model_call` declares
them (a ceiling of `0` means unlimited). Windows are UTC
calendar-day and calendar-month. Per-call cost resolves in order:
`metadata["estimated_cost_usd"]`; `compute_cost` over
`metadata["pricing"]` (the P19 cost metadata placed on the request by
the model-binding hook) with the configured
`estimate_input_tokens`/`estimate_output_tokens`; else
`default_call_cost_usd` (default `0.0` — cost is never guessed, so
unpriced calls pass without consuming budget unless a default is
configured). A call whose projected spend exceeds a ceiling MUST be
denied with a reason naming the window, ceiling, and spend, and MUST
NOT be recorded; an allowed call records its estimate. Spend state
SHALL be process-wide per persona (surviving resolver rebuilds), with
an in-memory ledger by default and an optional JSON-file ledger under
the persona's git-ignored `.cache/` directory when
`budgets.model_call.persist: file` is set. A persona-DB-backed ledger
is explicitly deferred.

#### Scenario: Ceiling allows then denies across calls

- **WHEN** `daily_usd: 1.0` is configured
- **AND** three `model_call` requests each carry
  `estimated_cost_usd: 0.4`
- **THEN** the first two MUST be allowed
- **AND** the third MUST be denied with a reason naming the daily
  ceiling

#### Scenario: Budget state survives resolver rebuilds

- **WHEN** two `PolicyGuardrails` instances are resolved for the same
  persona from independent `CapabilityResolver` calls
- **AND** the first instance's allowed calls consume the ceiling
- **THEN** the second instance MUST deny a call that would exceed it

#### Scenario: Daily window resets on the next UTC day

- **WHEN** the daily ceiling is exhausted
- **AND** the clock advances past UTC midnight
- **THEN** a new `model_call` request MUST be allowed again

#### Scenario: File-persisted ledger survives reload

- **WHEN** `persist: file` is configured and spend was recorded
- **AND** the ledger is re-created from the same spend file
- **THEN** previously recorded spend MUST still count against the
  ceilings

### Requirement: Delegation Constraints

The system SHALL enforce `guardrails.delegation` in
`check_delegation`, preserving the existing consumer contract (the
delegation spawner raises `PermissionError` when `allowed=False`):
a sub-role matching any `denied_sub_roles` glob is denied with a
reason naming the pattern, and a task longer than a non-zero
`max_task_chars` is denied. All other delegations are allowed.

#### Scenario: Denied sub-role glob blocks delegation

- **WHEN** `denied_sub_roles: ["cod*"]` is configured
- **AND** `check_delegation("chief_of_staff", "coder", task)` is
  called
- **THEN** the decision MUST have `allowed=False`
- **AND** delegation to `writer` MUST be allowed

#### Scenario: Spawner surfaces the denial

- **WHEN** the delegation spawner consumes a denied decision
- **THEN** it MUST raise `PermissionError` before loading the
  sub-role

### Requirement: Guardrail Risk Declaration

The system SHALL derive `declare_risk` from the configured policy for
the action: an action matched by a `deny` or `require_confirmation`
policy declares `RiskLevel.HIGH`; a `model_call` under configured
budget ceilings declares `RiskLevel.MEDIUM`; everything else declares
`RiskLevel.LOW`.

#### Scenario: Denied action declares HIGH

- **WHEN** a deny policy matches the action
- **THEN** `declare_risk` MUST return `RiskLevel.HIGH`

#### Scenario: Budgeted model call declares MEDIUM

- **WHEN** no policy matches a `model_call` action
- **AND** a model-call budget is configured
- **THEN** `declare_risk` MUST return `RiskLevel.MEDIUM`

### Requirement: Resolver Guardrail Selection

The capability resolver SHALL select the guardrail slot identically
on the host and sdk branches: an injected `guardrail_factory` wins
(unchanged); otherwise a persona whose parsed `GuardrailConfig` is
non-empty receives `PolicyGuardrails`; every other persona receives
`AllowAllGuardrails`, preserving pre-P13 behavior.

#### Scenario: Persona with guardrails gets PolicyGuardrails

- **WHEN** a persona declares a non-empty `guardrails:` section
- **AND** the resolver resolves either harness type
- **THEN** `CapabilitySet.guardrails` MUST be a `PolicyGuardrails`
  instance

#### Scenario: Persona without guardrails keeps AllowAll

- **WHEN** a persona declares no `guardrails:` section
- **THEN** `CapabilitySet.guardrails` MUST be `AllowAllGuardrails`

#### Scenario: Factory override preserved

- **WHEN** a `guardrail_factory` is injected into the resolver
- **THEN** the factory's instance MUST be used even when the persona
  declares `guardrails:`
